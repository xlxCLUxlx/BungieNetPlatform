    /// So much of what you see in Destiny is actually an Item used in a new and creative way. This is the definition for Items in Destiny, which started off as just entities that could exist in your Inventory but ended up being the backing data for so much more: quests, reward previews, slots, and subclasses.  In practice, you will want to associate this data with \&quot;live\&quot; item data from a Bungie.Net Platform call: these definitions describe the item in generic, non-instanced terms: but an actual instance of an item can vary widely from these generic definitions.

Just because an item is intrinsically transferrable doesn&#39;t mean that it can be transferred, and we don&#39;t want to imply that this is the only source of that transferability..</param>
        /// <param name="ItemCategoryHashes">BNet attempts to make a more formal definition of item \&quot;Categories\&quot;, as defined by DestinyItemCategoryDefinition. This is a list of all Categories that we were able to algorithmically determine that this item is a member of. (for instance, that it&#39;s a \&quot;Weapon\&quot;, that it&#39;s an \&quot;Auto Rifle\&quot;, etc...)  The algorithm for these is, unfortunately, volatile. If you believe you see a miscategorized item, please let us know on the Bungie API forums..</param>
        /// <param name="SpecialItemType">In Destiny 1, we identified some items as having particular categories that we&#39;d like to know about for various internal logic purposes. These are defined in SpecialItemType, and while these days the itemCategoryHashes are the preferred way of identifying types, we have retained this enum for its convenience..</param>
        /// <param name="ItemType">A value indicating the \&quot;base\&quot; the of the item. This enum is a useful but dramatic oversimplification of what it means for an item to have a \&quot;Type\&quot;. Still, it&#39;s handy in many situations.  itemCategoryHashes are the preferred way of identifying types, we have retained this enum for its convenience..</param>
        /// <param name="ItemSubType">A value indicating the \&quot;sub-type\&quot; of the item. For instance, where an item might have an itemType value \&quot;Weapon\&quot;, this will be something more specific like \&quot;Auto Rifle\&quot;.  itemCategoryHashes are the preferred way of identifying types, we have retained this enum for its convenience..</param>
        /// <param name="ClassType">We run a similarly weak-sauce algorithm to try and determine whether an item is restricted to a specific class. If we find it to be restricted in such a way, we set this classType property to match the class&#39; enumeration value so that users can easily identify class restricted items.  If you see a mis-classed item, please inform the developers in the Bungie API forum..</param>
        /// <param name="Equippable">If true, then you will be allowed to equip the item if you pass its other requirements.  This being false means that you cannot equip the item under any circumstances..</param>
        /// <param name="DamageTypeHashes">Theoretically, an item can have many possible damage types. In *practice*, this is not true, but just in case weapons start being made that have multiple (for instance, an item where a socket has reusable plugs for every possible damage type that you can choose from freely), this field will return all of the possible damage types that are available to the weapon by default..</param>
        /// <param name="DamageTypes">This is the list of all damage types that we know ahead of time the item can take on. Unfortunately, this does not preclude the possibility of something funky happening to give the item a damage type that cannot be predicted beforehand: for example, if some designer decides to create arbitrary non-reusable plugs that cause damage type to change.  This damage type prediction will only use the following to determine potential damage types:  - Intrinsic perks  - Talent Node perks  - Known, reusable plugs for sockets.</param>
        /// <param name="DefaultDamageType">If the item has a damage type that could be considered to be default, it will be populated here.  For various upsetting reasons, it&#39;s surprisingly cumbersome to figure this out. I hope you&#39;re happy..</param>
        /// <param name="DefaultDamageTypeHash">Similar to defaultDamageType, but represented as the hash identifier for a DestinyDamageTypeDefinition.  I will likely regret leaving in the enumeration versions of these properties, but for now they&#39;re very convenient..</param>
        /// <param name="Hash">The unique identifier for this entity. Guaranteed to be unique for the type of entity, but not globally.  When entities refer to each other in Destiny content, it is this hash that they are referring to..</param>
