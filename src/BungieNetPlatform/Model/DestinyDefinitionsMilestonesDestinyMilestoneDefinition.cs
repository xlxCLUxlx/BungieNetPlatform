    /// Milestones are an in-game concept where they&#39;re attempting to tell you what you can do next in-game.  If that sounds a lot like Advisors in Destiny 1, it is! So we threw out Advisors in the Destiny 2 API and tacked all of the data we would have put on Advisors onto Milestones instead.  Each Milestone represents something going on in the game right now:  - A \&quot;ritual activity\&quot; you can perform, like nightfall  - A \&quot;special event\&quot; that may have activities related to it, like Taco Tuesday (there&#39;s no Taco Tuesday in Destiny 2)  - A checklist you can fulfill, like helping your Clan complete all of its weekly objectives  - A tutorial quest you can play through, like the introduction to the Crucible.  Most of these milestones appear in game as well. Some of them are BNet only, because we&#39;re so extra. You&#39;re welcome.
