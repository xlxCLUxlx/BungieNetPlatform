## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**VendorHash** | **uint?** | The hash identifier of the Vendor related to this Milestone. You can show useful things from this, such as thier Faction icon or whatever you might care about. | [optional] 
**PreviewItemHash** | **uint?** | If this vendor is featuring a specific item for this event, this will be the hash identifier of that item. I&#39;m taking bets now on how long we go before this needs to be a list or some other, more complex representation instead and I deprecate this too. I&#39;m going to go with 5 months.
