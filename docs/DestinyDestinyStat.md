# BungieNetPlatform.Model.DestinyDestinyStat
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**StatHash** | **uint?** | The hash identifier for the Stat. Use it to look up the DestinyStatDefinition for static data about the stat. | [optional] 
**Value** | **int?** | The current value of the Stat. | [optional] 
**MaximumValue** | **int?** | The highest possible value for the stat, if we were able to compute it. (I wouldn&#39;t necessarily trust this value right now. I would like to improve its calculation in later iterations of the API. Consider this a placeholder for desired future functionality) | [optional]
